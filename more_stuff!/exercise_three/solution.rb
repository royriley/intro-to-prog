# What is exception handling?
# What problem does it solve?

# A specific process that deals with errors in a manageable
# and predictible way. It allows you to handle the possibility
# of an error ocurring in your program. You can handle the possibility 
# of an error by altering the flow of control, without exiting
# the program entirely.
