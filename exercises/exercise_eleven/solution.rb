# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources
# and say which one you like best and why.
# ruby-doc.org

# The Core API and Standard Library API - has to be a toss-up.
# Even at this early stage in learning Ruby, I can appreciate
# the value these two API sources provide the programmer.
# The time saved and errors prevented/located/corrected,
# make being able to use this information invaluable.
